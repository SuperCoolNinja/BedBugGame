# BedBugGame

A mini game made using Raylib in C.

# Why did you make this little clicker game ?

The reason why I created this mini game is simply
just stupid, in this shitty period I'm going through I have a
invasion of bugs in my house and then I was so tired of not sleeping because they were everywhere in my room that I had this stupid idea to create this game to take my anger out on them in game as well as doing it in real.

# Why i can't compile this source code and got signature error ?

At first this has not been shared to be used but simply to let an example of usage.
Else Well to be able to compile and use the source code, you will need to download the raylib library and redirect correctly the header path.

Copyright goes for :
@raysan5 for his amazing library simple to use and free.
@SuperCoolNinja for this little shitty mini game.
